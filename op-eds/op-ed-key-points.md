# College Applications:

*Many people feel that USA college admissions are highly skewed toward outdated metrics. Recent research has uncovered metrics that are better able to predict students' future performance in college. However, colleges are reluctant to adopt these new metrics.*

Rank the following points in terms of how relevant they are, relating to the above topic.

Rank the following points of information in terms of relevance to the subject topic at hand.
* Current admission guidelines for US colleges admissions offices fail to admit many top quality students.
* Cumulative high school grade and ACT scores are widely used in the admissions process but are less predictive of student success than alternative measures.
* Cumulative high school grade is widely used in the admissions process but high grade point average (GPA) in senior years is more predictive of college success than high GPA in junior years.
* Average ACT scores are widely used in college admissions but scores for only the Math and English are more predictive of student success in college.
* Research shows a diverse student body can be obtained even with reweighed ACT scores.
* Schools should be unconcerned about brief fluctuations in college ranking scores (caused by different admissions criteria), if it results in a stronger student body.
* Improved admissions, resulting in improved graduation rates, will show in world rankings four years after initial implementation.
* There is currently an inherent disconnect between admissions offices and graduation rates (e.g. there is no direct feedback from graduation to the admissions decisions that were made four years prior).
* Admissions officers should be more engaged in the long term goals of the university rather than optimizing for world rankings.
* Currently colleges are not taking advantage of advanced statistical methods that can be used to predict student success.
* Beyond admissions, colleges should use Data Science as an early warning tool to detect students who need possible assistance.



# Interview Foibles:
*The 'get to know you' styled interview is becoming a popular trend. However, research shows that humans are surprisingly bad at inferring essential qualities about an applicant's character.*

Rank the following points in terms of how relevant they are, relating to the above topic.

* Circumstance may be highly misleading in an interview scenario as an interviewee's demeanor may depend highly on external, hidden circumstances.
* An interviewee's conduct may be interpreted differently by different interviewers.
* Unstructured, 'get-to-know' interviews are becoming popular in the workspace and in college admissions and forms a is a poor metric for predicting future job performance
* In unstructured, 'get-to-know' interviews, interviewers typically form strong but unwarranted impressions about interviewees, often revealing more about themselves than the candidates.
* Past research has demonstrated that the judgment of the interviewers adds nothing of relevance to the admissions process.
* Interviews can actually be harmful to the hiring process, undercutting the impact of other, more valuable information about interviewees.
* Research shows that students are better at predicting other students' GPA scores when no interview is conducted.
* When interviewees respond randomly to interview questions, the interviewer is unable to detect this trend.
* When interviewees respond randomly to interview questions, the interviewer has a strong belief that she 'got to know' the interviewee.
* Interviewers naturally turn irrelevant information into a coherent narrative, biasing their conclusions.
* Interviews that are structured so that all candidates receive the same questions, have been shown to make interviews more predictive of future job success.
* Interviews should be used to test job related skills.



# Addiction to Video Games:
*Rhetoric stating that video games are addictive and comparing them to drugs is misguided. The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed to have video gaming included in its catalog of mental diseases.*

Rank the following points in terms of how relevant they are, relating to the above topic.

* Video gaming is not damaging or disruptive to one's life and thus should not be compared to a drug.
* Dopamine levels that are released whilst playing video games are vastly lower than those released whilst taking a drug such as methamphetamine.
* The fact that a pleasurable activity released dopamine is uninformative, as dopamine is released whilst playing video games, taking drugs and whilst partaking in any form of pleasurable activity.
* The American Journal of Psychiatry has published a study showing that at most 1 percent of video game players might exhibit characteristics of an addiction.
* The American Journal of Psychiatry has published a study showing that gambling is more addictive than video games.
* The American Journal of Psychiatry has published a study showing that the mental and social heath of the video game addicts is no different from individuals who were not addicted to video games.
* Treating the immoderate playing of video games as an addiction, is pathologizing relatively normal behavior.
* We and our children are 'addicted' to new technologies because, they improve our lives or are simply pleasurable.
* Evidence for addiction to video games is virtually nonexistent.
* Using video gaming to relax does not constitute an addiction in much the same way as watching sports is not addictive.
