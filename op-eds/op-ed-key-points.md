# College Applications
* Current admission guidelines for US colleges admissions offices fail to admit many top quality students.
* Cumulative high school grade and ACT scores are widely used in the admissions process.
* Cumulative high school grade and ACT scores are less predictive of student success than alternative measures.
* High grade point average (GPA) in senior years is more predictive of college success than high GPA in junior years.
* ACT scores are reported as a rounded average of scores on four individual sections of the ACT test (Math, English, reading and Science).
* Averaged ACT scores place equal weight on all four sections of the ACT for college admissions.
* Maths and English ACT subject tests are more predictive of college success than reading and science tests.
* Research shows that re-weighting high school GPAs and ACT scores does not affect the diversity of the admitted student body.
* Popular college ranking (e.g. U.S. News & World Report) use old (GPA and ACT) scores for their reporting.
* Due to different ranking criteria, schools that adopt new admissions criteria may see an initial drop in college ranking.
* Improved admissions, resulting in improved graduation rates, will show in world rankings four years after initial implementation.
* There is an inherent disconnect between admissions offices and graduation rates (e.g. there is no direct feedback from graduation to the admissions decisions that were made four years prior).
* There is the need to engage admissions offices in long term goals of the university.
* Data science, as a tool that can be used to predict student success, is becoming more popular in certain colleges admissions life-cycles.
* Most colleges are not applying statistical predictive techniques to enhance admissions.

# Interview Foibles
* Circumstance may be highly misleading in an interview scenario.
* An interviewee's demeanor may depend highly on external, hidden circumstances.
* Interview conduct may be interpreted differently by different interviewers.
* Interview performance is a poor metric for predicting future job performance.
* Unstructured, 'get-to-know' interviews are becoming popular in the workspace and in college admissions.
* In unstructured, 'get-to-know' interviews, interviewers typically form strong but unwarranted impressions about interviewees, often revealing more about themselves than the candidates.
* Past research has demonstrated that the judgment of the interviewers adds nothing of relevance to the admissions process.
* Interviews can actually be harmful to the hiring process: undercutting the impact of other, more valuable information about interviewees.
* Research shows that students are better at predicting other students' GPA scores when no interview is conducted.
* When interviewees respond randomly to interview questions, the interviewer is unable to detect this trend.
* When interviewees respond randomly to interview questions, the interviewer has a strong belief that she 'got to know' the interviewee.
* Interviewers naturally turn irrelevant information into a coherent narrative: biasing their conclusions.
* People are bad at 
* Interviews that are structured so that all candidates receive the same questions, have been shown to make interviews more predictive of future job success.
* Interviews can rather be used to test job related skills.
* Unstructured interviews are likely to remain a popular interviewing technique into the future.
