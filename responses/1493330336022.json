I could. This is interesting though. One factor that will complicate your analysis is that more of the arguments for the first position were compelling than for the second two (though perhaps I'm biased by the format). So direct quantitative comparison between the formats, which doesn't account for the inherent differences in the distribution of argument persuasivenesses, might be misleading.\n\n"}
