Particularly when needing to evaluate several equally poor statements, needing to determine an ordering among those was not as easy as simply assigning a score to each statement. I believe that the scoring mechanism will allow you to see definitive separation between stronger and weaker statements as the gap between their position/score can be demonstrably widened."}
