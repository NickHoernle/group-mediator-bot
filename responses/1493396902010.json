It's easier and faster to compare a given argument with two or one adjacent arguments than it is to judge them in absolute terms. \n\nI think the formats in Questions 2 and 3 are probably equivalent for selecting the best subset of five arguments. I disliked the format in Question 1 because it requires more work to compare different arguments. "}
