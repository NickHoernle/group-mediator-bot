Placing the different points in order is the most difficult and requires the most time as you have to read through each point multiple times in order to make comparisons and form the list in the order you want. Ranking the points on a scale of 1-10 is also relatively easy, but may not give the most accurate results as I often just end up choosing a random number in the region of important (6-10) or unimportant (which in this case I just left as 1 as I had 5 points already)."}
