The constraint of only choosing the 5 most relevant points necessitates the person to do some sort of ranking.\nI like the simplicity of selecting the 5 points (the third format presented), but my preferred format of scoring each point from 1 to 10. This allowed me to assign 1 to the points I would never use and also put together a list of the points I would use in my debate. Furthermore, the usable points are now ranked in order, which may be handy when selecting points in a debate."}
