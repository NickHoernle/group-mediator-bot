This made it visually easy to follow the order of 10 items and reorder as needed. I also liked the \"choose the best 5\" voting format, because I didn't have to select options that I felt were irrelevant, and also because I didn't have to put them in an order and found many choices to be equally as good as another. It was also quick and easy. I disliked the \"insert order\" voting option because it was cumbersome to go back and re enter numbers and ensure I didn't rank multiple options with the same number. I liked it better when it resorted for me.."}
