I wasn't clear on what a few of the statements meant, not being familiar with the US system myself. I found selecting 5 relevant points the easiest selection, probably because I didn't need to have organized my thoughts as much as the first two that required specific ranking or scoring. I therefore believe that the relevant selection will probably result in the most whereby subsection of 5 points :)"}
